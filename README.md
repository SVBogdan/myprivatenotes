I made this app with the help of [Vandad Nahavandipoor's Free Flutter Course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8NpGP0AOQ0kX9ZRcohiPeQ)

## Why I made this app
This project is a starting point for a person who wants to learn Flutter.

It helped me learn about : Dart, Developer accounts, Widgets, How Flutter works, Git and GitHub, Firebase backend, Auth Service, CRUD Local Storage, Working with data streams, CRUD cloud Firestore, Bloc, Localization and many others.
